                                    living individual (“identifiable”
                                    refers to being able to identify the living individual when the information held is

                                <p>How Will We Comply With Data Protection Laws?</p>
                                <p>Data Protection Laws require that we meet certain lawful grounds before we are
                                    allowed to use your personal data in the
                                    manner described in this Privacy Policy and that we explain these legal grounds to
                                    you. We take our responsibilities
                                    under Data Protection Laws seriously, including meeting these conditions. To use
                                    your personal data, we will rely on the
                                    following lawful grounds (more than one ground may be relevant to each example of
                                    our processing):</p>
                                <p>Contract: Where you are an existing customer we will process your personal data to
                                    the extent required for us to provide
                                    you with our services in accordance with agreed terms (for example existing
                                    customers can make a payment, request
                                    information in respect of how to obtain additional finance etc.) Additionally, if
                                    you are not an existing customer but
                                    you have requested further information about one of our products or services, we
                                    will use your personal data to provide
                                    you with such requested information;
                                    Legitimate Interests: We will also process your personal data where this processing
                                    is in our “legitimate interests”. It
                                    is in our legitimate interests to collect your personal data as it provides us with
                                    the information that we need to run
                                    the Website or provide our services and/or products more effectively. When relying
                                    on this condition, we are required to
                                    carry out a balancing test of our interests in using your personal data (for
                                    example, in order to improve the Website or
                                    our services), against the interests you have as a citizen and the rights you have
                                    under Data Protection Laws (for
                                    example, to not have your data sold to third party marketing companies without your
                                    knowledge, or store your personal
                                    data in insecure or unstable countries/ regions). The outcome of this balancing test
                                    will determine whether we can use
                                    your personal data in the ways described in this privacy policy. We will always act
                                    reasonably and give full and proper
                                    consideration to your interests in carrying out this balancing test; and</p>
                                <p>Legal obligation: Where there is a legal requirement upon us to record, retain or
                                    share your personal data with
                                    authorities, we must do so. For example to comply with laws and regulations which
                                    govern our business, such as the
                                    Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.
                                    Substantial Public Interest: Where you have a health issue and we are notified about
                                    that issue by you or by someone
                                    else, we may record this sensitive personal data where it is necessary for reasons
                                    of substantial public interest, to
                                    allow us to comply with the Equalities Act 2010 and make reasonable adjustment for
                                    you if required.</p>
                                <p>Consent: Where you have provided your consent, we also rely on your consent to use
                                    your personal data in certain ways
                                    (for example, in some circumstances to market our products and services to you).</p>

                                    providers may have back up or disaster
                                    recovery data centres that are located in multiple jurisdictions outside the EEA
                                    (for example, in the United States).
                                    This may mean that in certain limited circumstances personal data is transferred to
                                    countries which do not provide the

                                <p>1. A right to access personal data held by us about you.<br>

                                    2. A right to require us to rectify any inaccurate personal data held by us about
                                    you.<br>

                                    3. A right to require us to erase personal data held by us about you. This right
                                    will only apply where (for example): we

                                    or where you withdraw your consent
                                    (if we are using your personal data based on your consent); or where you object to

                                    would have the right to require us to
                                    erase the personal data but would prefer that our processing is restricted instead;
                                    or where we no longer need to use
                                    the personal data to achieve the purpose we collected it for, but you require the
                                    data for the purposes of dealing with
                                    legal claims.<br>

                                    5. A right to receive personal data, which you have provided to us, in a structured,
                                    commonly used and machine readable
                                    format. You also have the right to require us to transfer this personal data to
                                    another organisation, at your request.<br>

                                    6. A right to object to our processing of your personal data (including for the
                                    purposes of sending marketing materials

                                    Google Analytics and give us information about the time you spent on the Website,

                                    computer or other device when they close their web browser – until such time as they

                                    some of the pages on the Website contain embedded content from third party websites
                                    – such as video from YouTube,
                                    Twitter or LinkedIn for example. Because this content is from another website, we do
                                    not control the cookies which
                                    relate to this. If a user wants to change their cookie preferences to block these
                                    third party cookies, they should check
                                    the third party websites for information on how to manage their cookies.</p>
                                <p>We may also embed social sharing icons throughout the Website. These sharing options
                                    are designed to enable users to
                                    easily share the Website’s content with their friends using a variety of different
                                    social networks. These social sharing
                                    sites may set a cookie when a user is logged into their service. Please note that we
                                    do not control the dissemination of
                                    these cookies and users should consult the relevant third party website for
                                    information on how these cookies are used
                                    and how the user can control them.</p>
